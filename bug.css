The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:hover` pseudo-class in conjunction with a nested element:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  margin: 50px;
}
```

The intended effect is that when hovering over the `.container`, the `.inner` element's background color changes to lightcoral. However, this only occurs if the mouse cursor is precisely over the `.inner` element itself, not the `.container` as a whole. This is due to specificity issues where the specificity of `.container:hover .inner` is not high enough compared to `.inner`.

This is an uncommon issue because many developers don't encounter this problem, especially those using simple CSS structures.  However, with more complex nested selectors and specificity, such issues can arise.
