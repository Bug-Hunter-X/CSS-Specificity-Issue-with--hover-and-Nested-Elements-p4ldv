# CSS Specificity Issue with :hover and Nested Elements

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS specificity issue that can occur when using the `:hover` pseudo-class with nested elements.  The issue is that the hover effect might not apply to the nested element unless the mouse cursor is directly over the nested element.

## Problem Description

The problem stems from the fact that the specificity of the `:hover` pseudo-class selector is not always high enough to override the style applied to the nested element itself. This results in unexpected behavior when one might expect the hover state to cascade down to the nested element.

## Solution

The solution involves increasing the specificity of the hover selector to ensure it overrides other styles. This can be achieved by adding an extra class, using more precise selectors, or utilizing the `!important` flag (although the latter is generally discouraged).
